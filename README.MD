# Mute Evasion
## A ct module to send messages to an alt account automatically when you are muted on hypixel.

- [x] Basic module that can read messages sent and work out which ones are meant to be sent as chat messages
- [x] Functional way to send messages from muted client to unmuted client
- [ ] Functional way to sent messages from unmuted client to muted client (for things like /msg)
- [ ] Fix a ton of bugs I know exist.
- [ ] Make nice setup instructions 

## Why?

I got muted on hypixel for a month so I made this. Yes it would have been easier to open up 2 games instead of one, but this exists now.

## Setup

TODO
This is still being made so the setup instructions will change
However it should be easy to work out if you have used mineflayer and chat triggers.
The node modules you need to install are ws and mineflayer.
I will make a nice setup for this at some point.
